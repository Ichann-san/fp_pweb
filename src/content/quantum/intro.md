# Introduction to Quantum Computing

Welcome to the fascinating world of Quantum Computing! Prepare to explore concepts that challenge our classical understanding of computation.

## What is Quantum Computing?

Quantum computing harnesses the principles of **quantum mechanics** to process information in fundamentally new ways.

## Classical vs Quantum

| Classical Bits | Quantum Bits (Qubits) |
|----------------|----------------------|
| 0 or 1 | 0, 1, or both simultaneously |
| Deterministic | Probabilistic |
| Linear scaling | Exponential potential |

## Key Quantum Principles

1. **Superposition** - A qubit can be in multiple states at once
2. **Entanglement** - Qubits can be correlated regardless of distance
3. **Interference** - Quantum states can amplify or cancel each other

## Simple Visualization

```
Classical bit:  |0⟩ OR |1⟩

Quantum qubit:  α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
                (Both states at once!)
```

## Why Quantum Computing?

- **Cryptography** - Breaking and creating unbreakable codes
- **Drug Discovery** - Simulating molecular interactions
- **Optimization** - Solving complex logistics problems
- **Machine Learning** - Faster training of AI models

## Prerequisites

To succeed in this course, you should have:
- Basic understanding of linear algebra
- Familiarity with complex numbers
- Curiosity and an open mind!

> **Note:** Quantum computing is still emerging. We're learning together as the field evolves!
