# Introduction to Data Science

Welcome to Data Science with Python! Learn to extract insights from data and build predictive models.

## What is Data Science?

Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data.

## The Data Science Process

```
Data Collection → Cleaning → Analysis → Visualization → Modeling → Deployment
```

## Why Python for Data Science?

| Advantage | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Easy Syntax | Readable and beginner-friendly |
| Rich Libraries | NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow |
| Community | Massive support and resources |
| Versatility | From analysis to production |

## Essential Libraries

```python
import numpy as np       # Numerical computing
import pandas as pd      # Data manipulation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Visualization
import seaborn as sns    # Statistical graphics
from sklearn import *    # Machine Learning
```
