# Introduction to HTML

Welcome to the HTML course! HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of every website on the internet.

## What is HTML?

HTML is a **markup language** that defines the structure of web content. It uses a series of elements (tags) to tell the browser how to display content.

## Basic Structure

Every HTML document follows this basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Key Concepts

1. **Elements** - Building blocks of HTML (e.g., `<p>`, `<div>`, `<h1>`)
2. **Attributes** - Additional information about elements (e.g., `class`, `id`, `src`)
3. **Nesting** - Elements can contain other elements
4. **Semantic HTML** - Using meaningful tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`

## Why Learn HTML?
