# Introduction to CSS

Welcome to the CSS course! CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes websites beautiful and visually appealing.

## What is CSS?

CSS is a **styling language** that describes how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, paper, or other media.

## Basic Syntax

CSS uses a simple rule-based syntax:

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}

/* Example */
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
    text-align: center;
}
```

## Ways to Include CSS

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Inline | Using `style` attribute directly on elements |
| Internal | Using `<style>` tag in the `<head>` |
